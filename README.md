### What is Simple ECS

Simple ECS is an Entity Component System framework made with Unity in mind.
My main goal was to make the framework as simple as possible while retaining all the benefits associated with traditional ECS.
This framework is still in early days though, so there may be bugs and large framework changes from time to time. 

For those interested on how to use SimpleECS please refer to the wiki for more information.
